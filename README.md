# Working Skill Repo

Voice-friendly KB workflow skills and required reviewer agents for GitHub
Copilot and Codex.

Most of this repo is an augmentation layer on top of the ATV StarterKit and CE
review/learning workflow. KB adds the voice-friendly routing, project-memory
map, fresh-session handoff loop, proportional planning, and execution gates; it
still depends on selected ATV skills and reviewer agents.

This repo is the portable skill bundle I use when I want an agent to walk into a
project, recover local project memory, choose the right workflow, execute work in
vertical slices, test its own changes, review the result, and leave durable
handoff/context files behind.

KB means **Kanban-Based**. The underlying workflow still uses boards, manifests,
vertical slices, and done archives, but user-facing commands use the shorter
`kb-` prefix because it works better with voice input.

## Fresh Session Loop

This workflow is meant to make every new task safe to start in a fresh session:

1. Finish or pause the current task with a handoff.
2. Close the old session.
3. Start a new session in the project repo.
4. Run `kb-start <next task or handoff>`.

`kb-start` calls `kb-map`, which reads the local project memory and points the
new session to the specific files it needs. The handoff tells the model what
work is being resumed; `docs/context/PROJECT.md` tells it what the app is and
where the relevant architecture docs live. The goal is to stop carrying days of
chat history just so the model remembers what the app is.

## What This Repo Is

This is not the full ATV StarterKit. It is the smaller working set that should be
safe to copy into active projects without dragging in every experiment or
historical workflow. The reviewer agents are still part of the required runtime
surface; `document-review`, `ce-review`, `kb-complete`, and related gates fail or
degrade without them.

It includes:

- repo-local GitHub Copilot skills in `.github/skills/`
- repo-local Copilot agents in `.github/agents/`
- root agent guidance in `AGENTS.md`
- Copilot guidance in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- a deterministic check helper at `.github/skills/kb-check/scripts/kb-check.ps1`

The default entry point is `kb-start`. In normal use, ask for work in plain
language and let `kb-start` choose the ceremony.

`kb-start` delegates project-memory setup to `kb-map`. Route decides what the
user's idea/request needs; map decides whether local memory needs lookup,
refresh, or first-time bootstrap.

`kb-start` replaces the older `kb-route` name. The behavior is the same front
door pattern, but the new name matches how you use it: start a session, map the
project, then choose the right lane.

`kb-map` is project-root anchored. It must resolve the active repo first and read
memory from that repo only; it should not search `~`, `.copilot/handoffs`, the
whole drive, or sibling repos unless you explicitly ask for cross-repo lookup.
It checks standard memory files by exact path under the repo root, not by
grep/glob.

Drive roots such as `E:\` are not valid project roots unless explicitly chosen.
If the repo root cannot be resolved, `kb-map` should ask for the project path
instead of searching the drive.

## Why KB Start Exists

`kb-start` is the workflow router. Its job is to choose the right lane for the
actual work, not blindly run the ceremony implied by the user's wording.

Every request starts by calling `kb-map lookup <request>` so the session has the
current project memory before it decides what to do. Then `kb-start` classifies
the work by task shape, risk, and available artifacts:

- Use `kb-fix` for small, bounded bugs or narrow changes where the likely fix is
  obvious and verification can prove it.
- Use `kb-brainstorm` when product behavior, technical framing, success
  criteria, or tradeoffs are still unclear.
- Use `kb-plan` when requirements or a handoff already explain the work and the
  next useful output is vertical slices.
- Use `kb-work` when a valid manifest and slice plans already exist.
- Use `kb-epic` when the request is too large for one brainstorm or manifest:
  migrations, framework rewrites, multi-subsystem initiatives, or long backlogs.
- Use `kb-research` only when external docs, prior art, framework behavior, or
  known failure modes could change the decision.

The goal is proportional ceremony. A typo fix should not become a brainstorm. A
framework migration should not become a quick fix. A clear handoff should not
rerun discovery just because the user said "brainstorm" casually. The user's
words are input; the route should be based on the actual task, the repo memory,
and the cost of being wrong.

## Why KB Map Exists

`kb-map` is the context router for fresh sessions.

The workflow assumes sessions are disposable. Instead of keeping one expensive
chat open for days, a new session should be able to enter a repo, ask "what am I
working on?", and get pointed to the exact local memory needed for the current
handoff, bug, feature, or plan.

`kb-map` makes that possible by resolving the active project root, checking the
standard memory files, and loading only the relevant pointers:

- `todo.md` for current work, blockers, parked items, and handoff links
- `docs/context/PROJECT.md` for the app map and subsystem index
- `docs/context/architecture/*` for the subsystem involved in the current task
- `docs/context/operations/*` for run, test, QA, and deploy commands
- `docs/handoffs/*` for resumable work packets

`docs/context/PROJECT.md` is the entry map. It explains what the app is, how to
run and test it, what major subsystems exist, and which subsystem documents to
read next. `docs/context/architecture/*.md` files are the deeper subsystem
notes. `kb-map` should read `PROJECT.md` first, then follow its pointers to the
smallest relevant architecture file for the current task.

The point is not to load every architecture file or crawl the whole repo. The
point is to guide the model directly to the slice of project truth that matters
now, so each token pays for useful orientation instead of rediscovery.

When memory is missing, `kb-map` invokes `kb-map-bootstrap` to build the project
map once. After that, normal startup should be cheap: `kb-start` calls
`kb-map lookup <request>`, `kb-map` returns the relevant docs and likely route,
and the next skill can work without the user reteaching the app.

## Quick Use

Use these when you know the route:

| Command | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `kb-start` | Fresh session, ambiguous ask, or "figure out the right workflow" |
| `kb-map` | Setup, lookup, or refresh project memory before other work |
| `kb-fix` | Narrow bug, failing test, or small contained change |
| `kb-brainstorm` | Product or technical framing is still unclear |
| `kb-plan` | Requirements exist and need vertical slices |
| `kb-work` | A manifest exists and should be executed |
| `kb-complete` | Work is done and needs review, learning, cleanup |
| `kb-ship` | Release, PR, deploy, or final readiness check |
| `kb-epic` | Large migration, rewrite, or multi-brainstorm initiative |
| `klfg` | Fully hands-off route: brainstorm -> plan -> work -> complete |

Phase boundaries:

- `kb-brainstorm` writes/reviews requirements, resolves safe/actionable P0-P4
  findings, and invokes `kb-plan` when the brainstorm is gate-clean. It pauses
  only for unresolved blockers, required human decisions, required research, or
  an explicit user stop.
- `kb-plan` writes the manifest and slice plans and recommends `kb-work`.
- `kb-work` executes all runnable slices and calls `kb-complete` only when every
  slice is done or intentionally skipped.
- Once `kb-work` starts execution, runnable slices continue without per-slice
  confirmation. It pauses only for HITL, blocked/manual work, destructive
  approval, scope failures, QA/repair exhaustion, dependency deadlock, or an
  explicit user stop.
- `klfg` is the full auto-chain.

Handoff routing is deliberately conservative:

- Handoffs are restart packets, not automatically executable plans.
- A handoff that links a valid `docs/plans/*-kb-*-manifest.md` can route to
  `kb-work`.
- A handoff with phases, workstreams, bullets, or broad next steps must route to
  `kb-plan` first so it becomes vertical slices with `expected_files` and
  verification.
- Before planning from a handoff, `kb-plan` checks for existing brainstorm,
  requirements, manifest, or plan files and uses the best existing source of
  truth instead of duplicating work.
- A handoff with unclear intent routes to `kb-brainstorm`; a multi-initiative
  handoff routes to `kb-epic`.

## Token Diet and Lazy References

Heavy inherited ATV/CE skills keep their routing and safety rules in `SKILL.md`,
but detailed phase mechanics live under `references/` and are loaded only when
that phase is actually running.

Current cuts:

- `ce-review` keeps mode detection, reviewer selection, severity/routing, and
  quality gates in the skill body. Full scope detection, dispatch, merge/dedup,
  headless output, fixer, artifact, todo, push, and PR flows moved to lazy
  references.
- `ce-compound-refresh` keeps the maintenance model, core rules, scope
  selection, investigation flow, and phase map in the skill body. Document-set
  analysis, action boundaries, decision prompts, execution flows, reporting,
  commits, and discoverability checks moved to lazy references.

Do not move a rule out of `SKILL.md` if missing it would make the skill choose
the wrong lane, mutate files unsafely, or skip a required gate. Move details out
when they are only needed after the lane/phase is already chosen.

## Agent Runtime Tiers

The agent files are split conceptually, even though they are all shipped today:

- **Required dispatch agents** are called by `document-review`, `ce-review`,
  `kb-complete`, and related gates. Removing these causes failed agent dispatch
  or degraded review.
- **Conditional specialist agents** are loaded only when the diff/task warrants
  the lens, such as security, performance, API contracts, migrations, design,
  browser/QA, or repo research.
- **Optional direct-use agents** can be removed later only after a benchmark run
  proves no skill dispatches them and no documented workflow depends on them.

Until that benchmark exists, keep `.github/agents/*.agent.md` intact. The prior
test failure proved that deleting ATV agents blindly is worse than carrying the
small file surface.

## Benchmarking Skills

Skill quality is measured by behavior, not by line count alone.

Use repeatable prompts against a scratch repo and record:

- correct route selected by `kb-start` (`kb-fix`, `kb-brainstorm`, `kb-plan`,
  `kb-work`, `kb-epic`, or `kb-research`)
- whether `kb-map` resolves the active repo root and exact memory files without
  searching the drive
- number of avoidable user questions
- whether planned slices include `expected_files`, verification, blockers, and
  HITL flags
- whether runnable slices continue without per-slice confirmation
- whether review agents dispatch successfully
- deterministic checks run by command instead of model judgment
- token/line load at skill start versus lazy phase load
- final artifacts moved to the right lifecycle file or folder

Optimize for fewer loaded tokens only when the same prompt still routes,
executes, verifies, and records state correctly. A shorter skill that drops a
gate is not an improvement.

## Portable Repo Hygiene

This repo should contain skills, agents, scripts, templates, and durable
references needed by the workflow. It should not carry project-generated
brainstorms, plans, handoffs, research notes, or context maps. Those artifacts
belong in the consuming project or in the larger ATV starter kit history.

## Not Bundled

These are intentionally left out of the minimal working bundle:

- upstream `deepen-*` passes; use `kb-research` and proportional research
- one-shot LFG/SLFG style workflows; use `klfg` only when you actually want the
  whole pipeline
- `land`; shipping remains a deliberate separate decision
- browser tools such as `agent-browser`; skills can call them when installed, but
  this repo does not vendor them

Do not remove `.github/agents/` from this bundle. The agent files are not
optional docs; they are the personas that the review and planning skills dispatch
at runtime.

## Project Memory

The workflow keeps memory in files so sessions can stay short.

Required project memory files:

- `todo.md` - active work, blockers, parked work, and handoff pointers
- `todo-done.md` - compact archive of completed work
- `docs/context/PROJECT.md` - project route map for fresh sessions
- `docs/context/architecture/` - concise architecture notes by domain
- `docs/context/research/` - reusable research findings
- `docs/context/decisions/` - durable decisions and tradeoffs
- `docs/handoffs/active/` - resumable work
- `docs/handoffs/parked/` - valuable work that is not currently runnable
- `docs/handoffs/done/` - completed or superseded handoffs

Fresh-session preflight:

- Start with `kb-start` for work requests.
- `kb-start` calls `kb-map lookup <request>` before choosing the lane.
- If `todo.md` or `docs/context/PROJECT.md` is missing, `kb-map` invokes
  `kb-map-bootstrap`.
- If the context or handoff folders are partially missing, `kb-map` refreshes or
  creates the missing structure.
- Do not ask before bootstrapping unless a non-empty user file would be
  overwritten.

This replaces older `docs/kanban.md`, `docs/kanban-done.md`, `kb.md`,
`kb-done.md`, and ad-hoc handoff naming for the KB workflow.

`todo.md` is not a history file. Keep board rules at the top of `todo.md`, not
in a separate `todo-rules.md`. When a feature, slice group, handoff, or fix is
complete, move the compact summary to `todo-done.md` and remove the completed
entry plus routine completion logs from `todo.md`.

## Execution Model

The pipeline is designed around three task sizes:

- **Small:** use `kb-fix`. Write or identify a failing check, make the smallest
  fix, run deterministic verification, and stop if the fix loop stalls.
- **Medium:** use `kb-brainstorm` -> `kb-plan` -> `kb-work`. Produce vertical
  slices with expected files, verification, dependencies, and HITL flags.
- **Large:** use `kb-epic`. Break the initiative into multiple brainstorms or
  manifests before execution.

`kb-gate` owns P0/P1/P2/P3/P4 handling. Findings are expected; human-in-loop is
based on who can safely decide, not severity alone. The agent should fix
safe/actionable findings itself and ask for human help only for product
decisions, credentials/access, unsafe operations, competing reasonable paths, or
genuine ambiguity.

`kb-check` and `kb-functional-test` push verification into code whenever
possible. The model should call deterministic checks instead of spending tokens
re-inspecting behavior by hand.

## Recommended Install

Default to personal/global installs. They keep active project repos clean and
avoid skill drift between copies.

GitHub Copilot personal install:

```powershell
$src = 'E:\working-skill-repo'
$skills = "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\skills"
$agents = "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\agents"
Copy-Item "$src\.github\skills\*" $skills -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "$src\.github\agents\*" $agents -Force
```

Shared agent-skills standard install:

```powershell
$src = 'E:\working-skill-repo\.github\skills'
$dst = "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills"
Copy-Item "$src\*" $dst -Recurse -Force
```

Codex personal install:

```powershell
$src = 'E:\working-skill-repo'
$skills = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills"
$agents = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\agents"
Copy-Item "$src\.github\skills\*" $skills -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "$src\.github\agents\*" $agents -Force
```

Use repo-local installs only when a project needs pinned/project-specific
overrides or when the skills should be versioned with that codebase.

Repo-local GitHub Copilot install:

```powershell
$src = 'E:\working-skill-repo'
$dst = 'E:\path\to\your\project'
Copy-Item "$src\.github\skills" "$dst\.github\skills" -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "$src\.github\agents" "$dst\.github\agents" -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "$src\AGENTS.md" "$dst\AGENTS.md" -Force
Copy-Item "$src\.github\copilot-instructions.md" "$dst\.github\copilot-instructions.md" -Force
```

## Skill Quality Bar

KB skills should be structured, not brain dumps:

- frontmatter says exactly when to use the skill
- the body states the job, non-goals, and output contract
- workflows are split into phases with hard gates
- file paths, commands, and artifact locations are explicit
- questions are driven by blocking decisions, not a quota
- shared doctrine lives once and is referenced elsewhere
- long research, agent prompts, and scripts are lazy-loaded when needed

Every token must pay rent. Keep contracts, gates, paths, commands, error
handling, verification criteria, and escalation thresholds. Cut generic
programming advice, motivational text, repeated warnings, and long examples that
modern models do not need.

## Credits

This repo is primarily based on the ATV / All The Vibes skill set and its
Compound Engineering workflow.

It also borrows useful ideas from:

- [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), especially small
  composable workflow skills and vertical slicing
- [G-Stack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack), especially persistent workflow
  memory, QA ownership, and operating-system-style orchestration
- [kevin-copilot](https://github.com/shyamsridhar123/kevin-copilot), especially
  terse Copilot-first instruction surfaces

The goal is not to copy any one system. The goal is to keep the pieces that make
agents more reliable, cheaper to run, easier to resume, and harder to let off
the hook.
