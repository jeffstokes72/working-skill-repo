# Skill Minimalism and Proof Harness

Status: reviewed
Created: 2026-05-31
Last refreshed: 2026-05-31

## Intent

Reduce loaded skill surface without losing the user's core workflow:
fast repo recovery, first-principles honesty, deterministic verification, and
drift-safe propagation.

The principle is separation of concerns:

- global base skills encode behavior and enforcement;
- repo-local memory records project-specific evidence;
- lazy workflow skills load only when their lane is needed.

## Success Criteria

- `kb-map`, `kb-first-principles`, `kb-check`, and `kb-start` remain available
  as the base layer.
- Every workstream reaches a planning-complete state: manifest created, parked
  with rationale, or blocked by an explicit human decision.
- The eval harness proves freshness with `eval_run_id` and proves verifier
  integrity with protected-file SHA checks.
- Regression baselines persist and fail the gate on meaningful regressions.
- Skill deletion or merge candidates are blocked by reference integrity, route
  fixtures, sync hashes, and eval proof.
- Loaded-surface reports show route-level line/token reduction before and after
  trims.

## Architecture Decisions

- Do not move repo-specific learning into global skills. Global learning skills
  should operate on repo-local evidence files.
- Do not delete `kb-first-principles`; trim it to the behavioral brake:
  verify checkable claims, stop before edits on factual pushback, avoid fake
  certainty, and avoid wholesale reversal.
- Keep `kb-first-principles` provisionally standalone while direct-chat vs
  vibe-coding behavior is clarified; if embedded later, preserve the same brake.
- Do not delete `kb-map`; preserve project-root resolution and local memory
  lookup. Trim or lazy-load only details that do not affect fast session
  recovery.
- Treat landmines as local evidence with an owner surface and fix condition.
  Promote them into the owning skill/doc/generator instruction only after proof
  and human approval; archive them when fixed and verified.
- Keep `learn`/`evolve` numeric maturity gates, but add a human approval gate
  before generated `learned-*` skills are promoted or synced from this bundle.
- Treat `todo-*` as lazy lanes unless route fixtures prove they need to be
  globally available.
- Preserve TDD's anti-cheat landmine inside the pipeline: define the behavior
  oracle before implementation when practical, prove RED, protect the
  test/fixture with a SHA/manifest, then implement.
- Treat SHA checks as proof that the verifier ran against the intended files,
  not as a substitute for behavior checks.
- Treat root `todo.md` as the KB live backlog/execution board during planning.
  Do not add `backlog.md` unless `todo.md` fails under real load.

## Completion Review

- Review: P0=0 P1=1(resolved locally) P2=0 P3=0.
- Resolved finding: skill-eval baseline comparison now fails negative fixtures
  that incorrectly start passing.
- Proof: `go run ./cmd/kbcheck core`, `git diff --check`, and
  `go run ./cmd/kbcheck skill-sync-report` passed with 0 required sync issues.
- Review limitation: subagent review was not spawned because this session's
  delegation tool requires explicit user authorization for subagents; review was
  performed locally.

## Execution Queue

Complete. Future work belongs in Parked / Blocked or a new epic.

## Human Checkpoints

Planning blockers to ask first:

1. For direct chat vs vibe-coding, should `kb-first-principles` remain the
   standalone trust brake, or should `kb-start` embed a shorter trigger?
2. Should `kb-check` stay in the always-available base layer, or load only when
   work reaches verification?
3. Should active landmines live in `docs/context/landmines.md` with owner/fix
   metadata, or in `.atv/instincts/project.yaml` with a landmine type?
4. What exact human approval prompt should `evolve` use before promoting or
   syncing `learned-*` skills out of this portable bundle?
5. Should resolved landmines archive immediately when the owning surface is
   fixed and verified, with time-decay only for unfixed stale entries?
6. Confirm architecture deepening as a compact new lazy skill once route
   fixtures prove it is distinct from deslop and thermo-nuclear review.
7. Confirm how protected test-first oracles should appear in `kb-plan`/`kb-work`,
   then decide whether standalone `tdd` can be deleted once references are clean.
8. Confirm `todo-triage`/`todo-create` should merge around root `todo.md` as
   the KB live backlog/board, with no `backlog.md` unless volume proves it.
9. Should workflow-shape routing stay inside `kb-start`/`kb-epic`, or become a
   tiny lazy skill only if measurement shows it would bloat the base router?

Planning can continue with assumptions for non-trim infrastructure:

- Harness proof hardening assumes existing eval harness ownership remains.
- Loaded-surface measurement assumes route-to-skill usage can be approximated
  from configured skill files and explicit references.
- Reference graph cleanup assumes missing/legacy refs should be corrected to
  current skill names or prose.

Resolved execution/ship decision:

- ATV scaffold/plugin remain thinner optional bundles by default; required sync
  targets are Codex global, Copilot global, shared agents global, and ATV
  `.github/skills`.

## Parked / Blocked

- Skill deletion remains blocked until loaded-surface measurement and reference
  integrity are in place.

## Completion Criteria

- Every workstream has a manifest or is explicitly parked with rationale.
- `go run ./cmd/kbcheck core` exits 0.
- `git diff --check` exits 0 in every touched repo.
- Required sync targets report zero required issues.
- Token/line reduction is measured, not estimated from memory.
