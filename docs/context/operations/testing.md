# Testing Operations

Checked: 2026-05-29

## Current Commands

```powershell
git status --short
git diff --check
.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -List
.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All
```

## Skill Quality Contract

The cross-runtime quality contract lives in `config/skill-quality.json`.
It defines:

- Codex and GHCP instruction surfaces.
- Skill lint budgets and allowlists.
- Route/complexity eval locations.
- Required and optional sync targets.

`kb-check.ps1` discovers this repo as a skill repo when `.github/skills` and
`config/skill-quality.json` exist.

The sync drift report is read-only: it never copies files. It still exits
nonzero for required-target drift and is part of the blocking `kb-check -All`
gate. Optional ATV scaffold/plugin differences remain warnings until their
shipping contract is decided.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-sync-report.ps1
```

## Current Result

`kb-check.ps1 -List` now reports skill-repo checks when run here:

- `skill-lint`
- `route-complexity-eval`
- `skill-eval`
- `skill-eval-codex-dry-run`
- `skill-eval-ghcp-dry-run`
- `skill-eval-quality`
- `skill-sync-report`

`kb-check.ps1 -All` runs all three and exits nonzero when a required check fails.
Expected current warnings:

- missing `argument-hint` on inherited/older skills;
- hot-path skill size warnings;
- optional ATV scaffold/plugin drift or omissions.

Required targets should report zero required sync issues.

## Eval Mapping

`kb-eval-map` is the bootstrap-owned setup skill for repo-native evals. It
creates or updates `docs/context/eval-map.md`, detects the app pattern and
existing harnesses, chooses the right proof surface, and scaffolds one real smoke
eval only when the primary workflow is known and safe to run.

Runtime proof still belongs to:

- `kb-check` for deterministic commands;
- `kb-functional-test` for per-slice proof-level classification;
- `kb-qa` for browser/API/CLI workflow checks;
- `kb-regression-snapshot` for replaying previous passing behavior;
- `kb-complete` for final machine-verifiable proof.

Eval frameworks such as Langfuse, Braintrust, LangSmith, DeepEval, or Promptfoo
are optional adapters/exporters unless the target repo is an LLM/agent app where
prompt/output datasets are the native proof surface.

## Implemented Harness

- `scripts/skill-lint.ps1` validates required skill frontmatter, conflict
  markers, configured line budgets, allowlisted long skills, and referenced
  local files.
- `scripts/route-complexity-eval.ps1` validates the route-complexity fixture
  schema, computes deterministic complexity tiers, and checks over/under
  planning guard coverage.
- `scripts/skill-eval.ps1` scores captured skill result JSON against route
  fixtures, trace evidence, and structured claim checks. Its default self-test
  includes intentionally bad route/proof/claim results that must fail.
- `scripts/skill-eval-run-codex.ps1 -FixtureId tiny-typo-fix -DryRun` validates
  the Codex live-adapter plumbing without calling a model. Live mode is explicit
  because it invokes `codex exec`.
- `scripts/skill-eval-run-ghcp.ps1 -FixtureId tiny-typo-fix -DryRun` validates
  the GHCP live-adapter plumbing without calling a model. Live mode is explicit
  because it invokes GitHub Copilot CLI and relies on prompt-level JSON
  constraints plus deterministic parsing.
- `scripts/skill-eval-run-live-corpus.ps1 -All -Runtime codex,ghcp -DryRun`
  validates corpus orchestration across both adapters. Live mode is explicit and
  not part of `kb-check -All`.
- `scripts/skill-eval-claims.ps1` self-tests transcript-derived claim artifacts:
  true deterministic claims pass, false deterministic claims fail, and ambiguous
  claims are reported without becoming proof.
- `scripts/skill-eval-quality.ps1` self-tests output-quality rubric scoring for
  completeness, maintainability, relevance, proof quality, and right-sized
  ceremony.
- `scripts/skill-eval-regression-report.ps1 -RunRoot .atv/eval-runs`
  summarizes local live-run artifacts and compares them to a selected baseline
  when `-BaselinePath` is provided.
- `scripts/skill-sync-report.ps1` validates required skill-copy hashes across
  the working repo, Codex global, Copilot global, shared agents global, and ATV
  `.github` skills.

## Planned Harness Gaps

The current harness does not yet validate every desirable skill property. These
are planned gaps, not current capability:

- route skills have decision tables and escalation rules;
- execution skills name deterministic proof requirements;
- lazy references exist and are linked only when needed;
- broader live Codex/GHCP corpus covers more than the initial fixture;
- trace scoring covers forbidden shortcuts and required workflow reads;
- scaffold negative-validation proof for future consuming-repo smoke evals.

## Route Eval Seeds

Minimum prompt matrix:

| Prompt Shape | Expected Route |
|---|---|
| "Fix this failing unit test" | `kb-fix` |
| "The UI sometimes loses state; figure it out" | `kb-troubleshoot` |
| "Build this bounded feature; don't ask many questions" | `kb-plan` -> `kb-work` |
| "I have a vague product idea" | `kb-brainstorm` |
| "Migrate auth, billing, and deploy flow" | `kb-epic` |
| "Run this existing manifest" | `kb-work` |
| "Review and finish this diff" | `kb-complete` or `kb-review` depending state |
