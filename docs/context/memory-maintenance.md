# Memory Maintenance

## Active Signals

| Date | Type | Area | Issue | Suggested Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-29 | drift-risk | ATV propagation | ATV scaffold/plugin copies previously differed or omitted KB skills. Current policy expects all tracked roots to match unless a packaging exception is recorded. | Keep sync report visible for all targets; treat required drift as blocking. | closed |
| 2026-05-29 | bloat-risk | hot-path skills | Several hot-path skills exceed 400 lines, but the threshold is a review signal rather than an automatic trim target. | Closed by the rent table in `docs/plans/2026-06-10-011-kb-skill-bundle-hardening-manifest.md`; keep always-needed routing/gate content inline and extract only genuinely optional material. | closed |
| 2026-05-30 | distribution-decision | eval harness exporters | Local JSON/Markdown reports are now the source of truth; external dashboard exporters are optional but undecided. | Add an exporter only after a consuming workflow needs Langfuse, Braintrust, LangSmith, Promptfoo, or DeepEval. | open |
| 2026-06-01 | platform-proof | Go gate portability | Windows parity smoke proof exists for the native Go top-level gate, but macOS/Linux have not been exercised on real machines. GitHub workflow mutation was intentionally omitted from the 2026-06-10 push. | Run `go run ./cmd/kbcheck local-release` on macOS/Linux before claiming full OS parity. | open |
| 2026-06-10 | contributor-onramp | core gate | `core` included required sync drift checks, causing fresh or partially installed environments to fail before repo-local quality could be distinguished from deployment drift. | Keep `core` repo-local and enforce required sync drift through `local-release` / `skill-sync-report`. | closed |
| 2026-06-10 | drift-risk | review skills | `ce-review` and `kb-review` intentionally duplicate some reference files for portability, but slice 005 had no deterministic guard for shared-reference drift or documented owner/reason metadata for forks. | `config/skill-quality.json` declares shared review-reference pairs and intentional forks; `kbcheck review-reference-guard` runs in `core`. | closed |
| 2026-06-10 | drift-risk | review reference roots | The first review-reference guard was enumeration-based and did not sweep for newly duplicated common filenames or classify `document-review` overlaps. | Guard now sweeps configured review reference roots, fails unclassified common filenames, and classifies `document-review` overlaps. | closed |
| 2026-06-10 | install-profile | core closure | The core profile previously installed only six skills while those skills invoked a larger runtime graph. | Core now installs every runtime skill plus baseline review/document agents; full adds every specialist agent. | closed |
| 2026-06-10 | minimality | agent surface | `kbcheck minimality` now reports 11 unproven agents after the approved `cli-agent-readiness-reviewer` merge; remaining candidates are static-only and not deletion approvals. | Keep remaining candidates parked until explicit human approval and runtime proof. | open |
| 2026-06-10 | archive-policy | plans directory | Root `docs/plans/` had 100 files, making current work harder to find. | Archived 89 historical plan files under `docs/plans/archive/YYYY-MM/`; keep root focused on current-day active/recent plans. | closed |

## Closed Signals

| Date | Type | Area | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-29 | repeated-rediscovery | skill repo testing | Added `scripts/skill-lint.ps1`, `scripts/route-complexity-eval.ps1`, and `kb-check -All` integration. |
| 2026-05-29 | stale-doc | portable memory contract | Added repo-local memory and documented it as skill-bundle maintenance only. |
| 2026-05-31 | drift-risk | ATV propagation | Codified optional thin ATV scaffold/plugin policy in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `config/skill-quality.json`; sync report passes with 0 required issues. |
| 2026-05-31 | tooling-gap | OSV security proof | Installed `osv-scanner` locally through the official Go install path; `osv-scanner --version` reports 2.3.8. |
| 2026-05-31 | source-of-truth | ATV upstream resync | Recorded original `All-The-Vibes/ATV-StarterKit` `upstream/main` as authoritative for ATV-native imports, while preserving this repo as the KB overlay. |
| 2026-06-01 | test-flake | eval baseline selftest | Fixed shared temp-directory collision by giving each baseline selftest run a unique `.atv/eval-baseline-selftest-*` directory. |
| 2026-06-01 | test-flake | pipeline selftest | Fixed concurrent pipeline run collision by adding milliseconds plus a GUID suffix to generated pipeline run IDs. |
| 2026-06-01 | stale-doc | gate commands | Replaced current docs and agent instructions that pointed at retired `kb-check.ps1` / `kb-release-gate.ps1` wrappers with `cmd/kbcheck` commands. |
