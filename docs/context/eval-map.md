# Eval Map

Checked: 2026-07-11

## App Pattern

Skill/workflow repo. There is no app runtime. Correctness is defined by skill
structure, route-complexity fixtures, sync drift, and whether repo guidance gives
Codex/GHCP the same workflow contract.

## Primary Workflows

| Workflow | Surface | Current Proof | Gap | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skill structure remains valid | `.github/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck skill-lint` | Warnings remain for inherited older skills | P1 |
| Route complexity stays calibrated | `evals/route-complexity/*.json` | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck route-eval` | Fixtures are deterministic metadata, not live prompt runs; workflow-shape fixtures cover skill edit, skill-bundle, proof pipeline, and multi-stream epic prompts | P0 |
| Required skill copies stay synced | Codex, Copilot, and shared-agent global installs | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck local-release`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck skill-sync-report`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck doctor` | None beyond user-local install availability | P1 |
| Skill edits do not regress behavior | prompt/trace/claim evals | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck skill-eval`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck eval-run-codex`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck eval-run-ghcp` | Need broader live corpus and richer trace/claim scoring | P0 |
| Repair claims prove RED-before-GREEN | `.kb/trace.jsonl` and check JSON specs | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck sense`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck accept`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck trace-verify` | Per-slice check specs are created as needed, not globally cataloged yet | P0 |
| KB manifests cannot self-report done | `docs/plans/*-kb-*-manifest.md` | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck manifest-contract --manifest <manifest>` | Current check validates schema/gates; it does not run each recorded proof_check command itself yet | P0 |
| False completion is rejected | `evals/dishonest-completion/fixtures.json` | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck dishonest-completion-selftest` | Small deterministic corpus only; not a live-model benchmark | P0 |
| Route loops stop instead of oscillating | `.kb/runs/<goal>/route-history.jsonl` | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck run-state --history <history>`; `go run ./cmd/kbcheck run-state-selftest` | Needs more real run histories over time | P1 |
| Learning promotions are measured | adoption result JSON | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck learning-adoption --result-path <results.json>` | Needs broader real run corpus over time | P1 |
| Token efficiency is measured without rewarding weaker work | execution telemetry JSON | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck execution-telemetry --telemetry <telemetry.json>` validates normalized raw fields | Codex/GHCP adapters do not yet expose a stable measured-usage artifact; never substitute model-authored usage | P1 |
| Worker context remains bounded and vendor-neutral | context packet JSON | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck context-packet --packet <packet.json>`; `context-packet-selftest` in core | Real host adapters expose usage inconsistently | P1 |
| Optional providers do not become hidden runtime dependencies | repo and standard user provider configs | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck provider-hygiene`; provider-hygiene selftest in core | Host-specific plugin registries may need adapters later | P1 |
| Model-routing release claims stay inside their evidence | `evals/model-routing/*.json` and release evidence JSON | `go run ./cmd/kbcheck model-routing-release --cohort initial-pilot --evidence docs/results/2026-07-10-session-model-routing-initial-pilot.json` | Current evidence is deterministic, no-paid, and not promoted; live support and efficiency remain unqualified | P0 |

## Scaffolding Decisions

No new smoke eval is scaffolded by `kb-eval-map` for this repo yet because the
next useful smoke is not a placeholder; it is the planned live skill eval suite:
prompt routing, trace capture, claim verification, output quality scoring, and
cost telemetry.

The deterministic scorer exists as `go run ./cmd/kbcheck skill-eval`. It scores
captured agent result JSON against route fixtures and claim checks, and its
self-test includes intentionally bad route/proof/claim outputs that must fail.
The Codex and GHCP adapters exist as `eval-run-codex` and `eval-run-ghcp`;
dry-run mode is included in `core`, while live mode explicitly invokes
authenticated local CLIs. `eval-run-live-corpus` runs selected fixtures across
Codex and GHCP adapters and summarizes pass/fail/skip categories.
`skill-eval-claims` checks transcript-derived claim artifacts deterministically
and reports ambiguous claims without counting them as proof.
`skill-eval-quality` scores output-quality fixtures separately from
deterministic route/proof/claim pass/fail. `skill-eval-regression` summarizes
local live-run artifacts and compares pass/non-pass plus size/time proxies
against selected baselines.

## Deterministic vs LLM-Judged

| Check | Class |
|---|---|
| skill lint | deterministic |
| route-complexity fixture scoring | deterministic |
| captured skill result scoring | deterministic |
| proof-spine trace acceptance | deterministic |
| manifest done/proof contract | deterministic schema and gate check |
| dishonest completion rejection fixtures | deterministic negative selftest |
| route-history loop guard | deterministic JSONL check |
| doctor install-drift repair/refusal | deterministic fixture selftest |
| model-routing release claim boundary | deterministic strict evidence validation; fixture definitions are neither live support nor efficiency proof |
| measured learning adoption | deterministic |
| sync drift hashes | deterministic |
| git whitespace/conflict checks | deterministic |
| output quality scoring | deterministic rubric selftest |
| Codex skill prompt routing live run | mixed: model action plus deterministic route/trace scoring |
| final claim verification | deterministic filesystem/git/log checks |

## Credentials / Session Requirements

None for current deterministic checks.

The Codex adapter requires a working `codex` CLI and authenticated Codex session.
The GHCP adapter requires a working `copilot` CLI and authenticated Copilot
session. The deterministic scorer can run without those sessions when given
captured result JSON.

## Dashboard / Export Options

Keep local scripts as source of truth. Langfuse, Braintrust, LangSmith,
Promptfoo, or DeepEval can be adapters/exporters after local fixtures and scores
are stable.

## Open Eval Gaps

- Grow the live Codex/GHCP corpus beyond the current route fixture set.
- Capture normalized real token/cache/turn usage from live Codex/GHCP adapters;
  current regression reports use duration and artifact-size proxies only.
- Make `manifest-contract` optionally execute recorded `proof_check` commands
  after the schema and gate contract is stable.
- Optional exporters can be added for Langfuse, Braintrust, LangSmith,
  Promptfoo, or DeepEval after local JSON/Markdown reports remain stable.
