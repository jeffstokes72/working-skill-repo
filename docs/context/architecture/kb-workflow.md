# KB Workflow Architecture

This document holds the workflow detail that used to live inline in the root
README. The README is the front door; this file is the operating model.

## Fresh Session Loop

The workflow is meant to make every new task safe to start in a fresh session:

1. Finish or pause the current task with a handoff.
2. Close the old session.
3. Start a new session in the project repo.
4. Run `kb-start <next task or handoff>`.

`kb-start` calls `kb-map`, which reads local project memory and points the new
session to the specific files it needs. The handoff tells the model what work is
being resumed; `docs/context/PROJECT.md` tells it what the app is and where the
relevant architecture docs live.

## Route Selection

`kb-start` is the workflow router. It chooses the lane for the actual work, not
the ceremony implied by the user's wording.

Every request starts by calling `kb-map lookup <request>` so the session has
current project memory before route selection.

Typical routing:

| Shape | Lane |
| --- | --- |
| small known bug, typo, narrow cleanup | `kb-fix` |
| broken behavior with unclear cause | `kb-troubleshoot` |
| unclear product or technical framing | `kb-brainstorm` |
| requirements exist and need slices | `kb-plan` |
| valid manifest exists | `kb-work` |
| all slices are done and need completion gates | `kb-complete` |
| release, PR, deploy, or final readiness | `kb-ship` |
| multi-subsystem initiative or migration | `kb-epic` |
| external docs or prior art could change the decision | `kb-research` |

The goal is proportional ceremony. A typo fix should not become a brainstorm; a
framework migration should not become a quick fix.

## Map And Bootstrap

`kb-map` is the context router for fresh sessions.

It resolves the active project root, checks standard memory files, and loads
only the relevant pointers:

- `todo.md` for current work, blockers, parked items, and handoff links
- `docs/context/PROJECT.md` for the app map and subsystem index
- `docs/context/architecture/*` for subsystem detail
- `docs/context/operations/*` for run, test, QA, and deploy commands
- `docs/handoffs/*` for resumable work packets

`docs/context/PROJECT.md` is the entry map. It explains what the app is, how to
run and test it, what major subsystems exist, and which subsystem documents to
read next.

When memory is missing, `kb-map` invokes `kb-map-bootstrap` to build the project
map once. Bootstrap inventories the repo, reconciles discovered systems against
`PROJECT.md` and `docs/context/architecture/README.md`, runs `kb-eval-map`, and
route-tests every mapped major area.

Bootstrap must discover concepts, not just folders. It descends into substantial
child directories, clusters cross-cutting concerns, mines repo memories and
AGENTS/README files for subsystem hints, checks route/page and filename-prefix
patterns, and records known-unknowns.

Bootstrap also uses `kb-map-bootstrap/scripts/code-intel.ps1` when available.
That helper samples symbols, likely entry points, largest files, extension
counts, and language-server availability. It is a precision boost, not a
mandatory LSP dependency.

## Project Memory Contract

Required memory files in consuming projects:

- `todo.md`
- `todo-done.md`
- `docs/context/PROJECT.md`
- `docs/context/eval-map.md`
- `docs/context/architecture/`
- `docs/context/research/`
- `docs/context/decisions/`
- `docs/context/operations/`
- `docs/handoffs/active/`
- `docs/handoffs/parked/`
- `docs/handoffs/done/`

`todo.md` is not a history file. Keep board rules at the top of `todo.md`. When
a feature, slice group, handoff, or fix is complete, move the compact summary to
`todo-done.md` and remove completed routine logs from `todo.md`.

## Execution Model

The pipeline is designed around task sizes:

- **Small known bug:** use `kb-fix`.
- **Broken behavior with unclear cause:** use `kb-troubleshoot`.
- **Bounded autonomous task:** use `kb-task`.
- **Medium feature:** use `kb-brainstorm` -> `kb-plan` -> `kb-work`.
- **Large initiative:** use `kb-epic`.

`kb-plan` produces vertical slices with expected files, verification,
dependencies, test level, functional risk, and HITL flags.

`kb-work` executes the safe ready set from the slice dependency DAG. Once
execution starts, it does not ask before each slice. The default WIP is every
ready slice that can run in an isolated context without a serial-only gate.
Shared-checkout mutation still runs one slice at a time, and observed write
overlap serializes or requeues one of the colliding slices. `expected_files` is
a forecast, not the safety oracle. `kb-work` pauses only for real gates: HITL,
destructive approval, blocked/human-required work, scope failures, QA/repair
exhaustion, dependency deadlock, observed overlap that cannot be safely
serialized, or explicit user stop.

`kb-work` is not done when slices pass. It must invoke `kb-complete` after all
runnable slices are done or intentionally skipped.

`kb-complete` owns the terminal half of the loop:

- deterministic final checks
- `kb-review`
- P0/P1 resolution
- follow-up resolution
- proof/demo evidence
- compound/learn/evolve
- project memory refresh
- memory maintenance signals
- cleanup

## Verification

`kb-check` and `kb-functional-test` push verification into code whenever
possible. The model should run deterministic checks instead of spending tokens
re-inspecting behavior by hand.

`kb-functional-test` owns the test-level decision:

- `none`
- `unit`
- `integration`
- `functional-api`
- `functional-cli`
- `functional-browser`
- `full`

For UI work, `functional-browser` is automatic when `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, or
`.svelte` files change, or when backend/state behavior is primarily reached
through the app UI. Screenshots support evidence; executable assertions are the
pass/fail oracle.

`kb-regression-snapshot` records deterministic state after each passed slice in
`.atv/snapshots/<slice-id>.json`, then verifies prior snapshots before the next
slice starts.

`kb-complete` fails the proof gate when a slice only has prose proof. Each slice
needs command/test path, exit code, timestamp, trace/log/API artifact, or
snapshot verification evidence recorded in the manifest.

## Review Agents

`kb-review` uses a layered persona model.

Always-on:

- `correctness-reviewer`
- `testing-reviewer`
- `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-reviewer`
- `project-standards-reviewer`

Conditional:

- `security-reviewer`
- `performance-reviewer`
- `api-contract-reviewer`
- `data-migrations-reviewer`
- `reliability-reviewer`
- `adversarial-reviewer`
- `cli-readiness-reviewer`
- `previous-comments-reviewer`
- language and framework reviewers
- schema/deployment/agent-native reviewers

Document review has a separate lens-agent set for coherence, feasibility,
product, design, security, scope, and adversarial review.

## Token Diet

Heavy inherited ATV/CE skills keep routing and safety rules in `SKILL.md`, but
detailed phase mechanics live under `references/` and are loaded only when that
phase is running.

Do not move a rule out of `SKILL.md` if missing it would make the skill choose
the wrong lane, mutate files unsafely, or skip a required gate. Move details out
when they are only needed after the lane or phase is already chosen.
