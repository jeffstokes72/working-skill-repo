## Skill Bundle Surface

Primary files:

- `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` - portable skills.
- `.github/skills/*/references/*` - lazy-loaded detailed mechanics.
- `.github/skills/*/scripts/*` - deterministic helper scripts.
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` - reviewer and specialist agents dispatched by review/planning skills.
- `AGENTS.md` - Codex/agent repo contract and sync workflow.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Copilot always-on repo instructions.
- `README.md` - user-facing install, workflow, and design contract.
- `config/skill-marketplace.json` - private marketplace path, trust model, and
  promotion policy.

Reference docs:

- `docs/context/architecture/kb-workflow.md` - fresh-session loop, routing,
  project memory, execution, verification, review agents, and token diet.
- `docs/context/operations/skill-bundle-maintenance.md` - gates, sync targets,
  ATV upstream policy, marketplace promotion, security, and install snippets.

## Main Workflow Lanes

| Lane | Entry Skill | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Durable objective | `kb-goal` | Keeps long-running goal state, terminal proof, blockers, and next actions while delegating work to KB lanes. |
| Startup/routing | `kb-start` | Calls `kb-map`, then routes by task shape. |
| First-principles autonomous task | `kb-task` | Uses map, frames assumptions, delegates to the smallest correct lane. |
| Project memory | `kb-map`, `kb-map-bootstrap`, `kb-memory-review` | Creates and maintains repo-local memory in consuming projects. |
| Requirements/planning | `kb-brainstorm`, `kb-plan`, `kb-gate` | Converts unclear intent into requirements and vertical slices. |
| Execution | `kb-work`, `kb-fix`, `kb-troubleshoot`, `kb-repair` | Executes slices or smaller repair loops with proof gates. |
| Verification setup | `kb-eval-map` | Maps repo-native eval surfaces during bootstrap and documents/scaffolds the right harness for the app pattern. |
| Verification | `kb-check`, `kb-functional-test`, `kb-qa`, `kb-regression-snapshot` | Chooses and runs deterministic proof where available. |
| Completion | `kb-complete`, `kb-review`, `ce-compound`, `learn`, `evolve` | Review, memory, learning, and cleanup. |
| Release | `kb-ship`, `klfg` | Ship readiness or full pipeline orchestration. |
| Plan-to-PR finish | `kb-finish` | Explicitly runs plan/work/complete, then commits, pushes, and opens or updates a PR without merging. |

## Private Marketplace

See `docs/context/architecture/private-skill-marketplace.md`.

`<agent-marketplace>` is the private approved catalog for reusable skills and
pipelines. New learned skills should prove themselves project-local first, then
move into the marketplace only after evidence, review, hash pinning, and human
approval. Public marketplace imports go to quarantine, never directly to global
skill directories.

## Distribution Targets

Working source:

- `<working-skill-repo>\.github\skills\<skill>\`

Sync targets:

- `~/.codex/skills\<skill>\`
- `~/.copilot/skills\<skill>\`
- `~/.agents/skills\<skill>\`

Approved reusable catalog:

- `<agent-marketplace>\skills\<skill>\`
- `<agent-marketplace>\pipelines\<pipeline>.json`

## Current Coverage Gaps

- `kb-eval-map` is new; consuming repos still need eval maps created during bootstrap or refresh.
