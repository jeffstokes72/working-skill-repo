# Private Skill Marketplace

Checked: 2026-05-31

## Purpose

`E:/agent-marketplace` is the private trusted catalog for reusable agent skills
and pipelines. It is not a global install directory. It is an approval boundary
between project-local experiments, public marketplace imports, and global agent
skill directories.

The working skill repo knows about the marketplace through
`config/skill-marketplace.json`.

## Directory Contract

```text
E:/agent-marketplace/
  skills/       Approved reusable skill directories.
  pipelines/    Approved reusable pipeline manifests.
  harnesses/    Approved proof/check harness definitions.
  catalog/      Approval and quarantine indexes.
  quarantine/   Untrusted public or experimental imports.
  scripts/      Pull, ingest, review, and sync helpers.
```

Consuming projects keep local drift and run evidence in their own repos:

```text
<project>/
  .github/skills/learned-*          Project-local learned skills.
  config/pipelines/*.json           Project-local or pinned pipeline variants.
  .atv/pipeline-runs/               Run evidence.
  .agent-marketplace/skill-lock.json Pinned marketplace imports and valid drift.
  docs/context/marketplace-promotion.md Promotion notes when needed.
```

## Lifecycle

1. A project-specific behavior is learned in the consuming project.
2. `learn` records observations and `evolve` may create
   `.github/skills/learned-*` in that project after maturity and approval.
3. The learned skill stays project-local until it proves reuse value.
4. After repeated successful reuse, review, and human approval, the skill can be
   copied into `E:/agent-marketplace/skills/<skill>`.
5. Global installs pull only explicitly selected approved skills or loader
   skills. Quarantine never installs globally.

Pipeline promotion follows the same shape:

1. Start as a project-local `config/pipelines/<pipeline>.json`.
2. Accumulate successful run artifacts under `.atv/pipeline-runs/`.
3. Reference proof harnesses by ID rather than hard-coding every check into the
   skill.
4. Promote to `E:/agent-marketplace/pipelines/<pipeline>.json` only after proof
   artifacts, review, and approval.

## Promotion Signals

Default minimums live in `config/skill-marketplace.json`:

- confidence greater than or equal to `0.85`;
- at least `5` observations;
- last seen within `90` days;
- at least `2` successful reuses outside the original moment;
- explicit human approval before marketplace promotion.

These are minimums, not automatic permission. Security-sensitive, destructive,
or broad workflow skills still need manual review even when the numbers pass.

## Trust Rules

- Public marketplaces are discovery sources only.
- Public imports land in `E:/agent-marketplace/quarantine/`.
- Runtime loaders must never read from quarantine. The blocking firebreak is
  `scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak.ps1`, wired into `kb-check -All`.
- Approved marketplace skills are pinned by hash before pull/install.
- Global directories stay small. They are runtime install targets, not the
  private catalog.
- Project-local skills remain in the project until there is evidence they are
  reusable outside that project.
- Valid drift is recorded in `.agent-marketplace/skill-lock.json` with a reason
  instead of being treated as a sync error.

## Approved Security Skill

`atv-security` is approved as a trusted-source exception because it comes from
the local ATV security plugin maintained by trusted people. It is installed as a
single global security capability, not as a bulk import of ATV skills.

The approval is pinned in `E:/agent-marketplace/catalog/approved-skills.json`.
The approved marketplace copy and global Codex, Copilot, and shared agents
copies must hash-match the trusted ATV source before they are treated as
current.

The paired `dependency-vulnerability-osv` harness records the OSV Scanner proof
command for A06 dependency vulnerability checks. Missing `osv-scanner` is a
tooling skip, not permission to invent vulnerability findings from package age.

## Promotion Command

The safe marketplace path is automated by:

```powershell
.\scripts\promote-marketplace-skill.ps1 `
  -Source <reviewed-skill-dir> `
  -SkillId <skill-id> `
  -ApprovalReason "<why this is approved>" `
  -InstallTargets codex,copilot,agents `
  -Approved
```

The command validates frontmatter, copies the reviewed skill into approved
marketplace storage, computes and pins the `SKILL.md` hash, syncs selected
runtime globals, verifies hash equality, and runs the firebreak. If the approved
destination resolves into quarantine, it fails closed.

Use this command instead of direct global copy. Direct copy is only acceptable
when restoring a previously approved, hash-matched skill and should still be
followed by the hash/firebreak proof.

## Skill, Pipeline, Harness Boundary

- Skills perform work.
- Pipelines compose skills for a domain workflow.
- Harnesses prove pipeline outputs.

For example, an audiobook pipeline may compose `audiobook-book-writer`,
`audiobook-image-writer`, and `audiobook-audio-writer`, then prove outputs with
manuscript, image-artifact, and audio-file harnesses. A PowerPoint image review
pipeline can reuse the same image core ideas but use a presentation-specific
adapter and harness.

When a project changes a marketplace skill:

- general bug fix or invariant improvement: propose upstreaming to the base
  marketplace skill;
- domain-specific behavior: keep or promote as a named adapter skill;
- one-project taste or app constraint: keep project-local and record valid
  drift in the lock file.

## Implementation Notes

The first useful scripts should be boring and read-only:

- list marketplace contents;
- validate catalog JSON;
- compare approved skill hashes;
- report project-local promotion candidates.

Mutation scripts should come later:

- ingest public skill into quarantine;
- promote reviewed skill into `skills/`;
- pull selected approved skills into a project or global target.
