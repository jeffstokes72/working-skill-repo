outstanding:

# KB: Phoenix Routing/Slicing Absorption

## Origin

The useful Phoenix proof spine has already been absorbed. The remaining value is
not Phoenix's lifecycle vocabulary; it is the stricter contract that a goal has
an objective done check, each slice has an objective proof check or explicit
exception, and autonomous routing stops when it oscillates or loses confidence.

The latest critique adds three valid gaps:

- install drift has a report, but no Phoenix-style doctor/repair command;
- deterministic eval fixtures exist, but there is no public RESULT-style record
  proving KB workflow outcomes over a measured corpus;
- public polish should distinguish implemented proof from aspiration.

One critique item is stale locally: this repo already has `LICENSE`.

## Keep / Reject

Keep KB as the routing and slicing core. Do not fork Phoenix as the main app and
do not install the Phoenix skill pack beside KB. Absorb only the remaining
objective-contract mechanics that improve KB's planner and executor.

Reject:

- required Rust/MCP runtime;
- Phoenix lifecycle names as KB replacements;
- TokenMasterX or graph tooling as default;
- Phoenix's published metrics as claims for KB.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | Model | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix snapshot path drift and gate health | - | integration | small / local-5090-coder | no | done |
| 2 | Add manifest done_check and proof_check schema enforcement | slice-001 | tdd | medium / hosted-sonnet | no | done |
| 3 | Wire done/proof checks into KB skills | slice-002 | integration | medium / hosted-sonnet | no | done |
| 4 | Define KB-native run state and route-history guards | slice-002 | integration | large / hosted-large | no | done |
| 5 | Add measured eval result docs and release sync | slice-003, slice-004, slice-006 | verification-only | medium / hosted-sonnet | no | done |
| 6 | Add kb-doctor install drift repair | slice-001 | integration | small / local-5090-coder | no | done |

## Done Criteria

- `kbcheck` can validate manifests with `done_check`, `proof_check`, and
  `model_route`.
- `kb-plan` emits these fields for new manifests and slice plans.
- `kb-work` and `kb-complete` block false completion when required objective
  checks are missing or not accepted.
- Long-running goals have a documented `.kb/runs/<goal>/` state shape and
  route-history/stuck guard.
- `kbcheck doctor` or equivalent reports drift, repairs stale installed copies
  only from the working source, and blocks/flags possible global-only useful
  changes instead of overwriting them silently.
- KB publishes a small RESULT-style measured outcome record with fixtures,
  commands, dates, limitations, and no borrowed Phoenix metrics.
- README and eval-map document what is implemented, what is optional, and what
  Phoenix ideas remain rejected.
