# KB: ATV Security Marketplace Promotion

## Origin

Brainstorm: `chat:2026-05-31-atv-security-marketplace`

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change` - this promotes one trusted security skill, adds one deterministic security harness descriptor, and syncs known install targets without changing application runtime behavior.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Promote ATV security into the approved marketplace catalog | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Add OSV dependency-vulnerability proof to ATV security | - | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Install the approved ATV security skill into global targets | slice-051, slice-052 | integration | no | done |
| 4 | Run completion proof and record memory state | slice-053 | verification-only | no | done |

## Completion Review

- Review mode: `local-fallback` because no authorized reviewer subagent was invoked in this runtime.
- Findings: P0=0, P1=0, P2=0, P3=0.
- Residual risk: none for installation. A repo scan still needs dependency manifests or lockfiles in the target repo.

## Final Proof

- Marketplace JSON parsed with `ConvertFrom-Json`.
- Hash equality across trusted ATV source, ATV shipped copies, marketplace, Codex, Copilot, and shared agents: `1b0bcd8a05f79059e7bb8029ecb58d8a4e7492e3812664e3e577943fe9e650b0`.
- `osv-scanner --version` reports `2.3.8`; smoke scan against this repo executed but exited `128` because no package sources were present.
- `scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak.ps1` passed with `issues=0`.
- `scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak-selftest.ps1` passed by requiring the quarantined active-root case to fail.
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All` passed with 0 required sync issues.
- `git diff --check` passed in `<working-skill-repo>`, `<agent-marketplace>`, and `<atv-repo>`; output contained line-ending warnings only.

## Assumptions

- `<atv-repo>/plugins/atv-skill-atv-security/skills/atv-security/SKILL.md` is the trusted source for this promotion.
- `<agent-marketplace>` is the approved private catalog, not an auto-loaded global skill root.
- OSV Scanner is an optional executable proof path: absence of `osv-scanner` is recorded as `skipped-unavailable`, not silently replaced by model judgment.
