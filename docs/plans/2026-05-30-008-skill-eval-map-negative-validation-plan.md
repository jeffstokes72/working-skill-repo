# Slice 008: Add Eval-Map Scaffold Negative Validation

## What To Build

Strengthen `kb-eval-map` so future scaffolded smoke evals must record both a
passing command and an intentional negative check that failed as expected. This
turns "smoke eval exists" into "smoke eval can actually fail."

## Acceptance Criteria

- `kb-eval-map` requires pass-command and negative-check evidence in eval-map or
  testing docs for scaffolded smoke evals.
- The negative check language covers UI, API, CLI, file/config, and generated
  artifact workflows.
- Docs explain that failed negative validation means the smoke eval must be
  rewritten or deleted before reporting success.

## Verification

- Manual review of `kb-eval-map` scaffold policy against this slice.
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. `kb-eval-map` now treats scaffolded smoke eval validation as incomplete
unless pass evidence, failed-as-expected negative evidence, and revert evidence
are recorded.
