# Slice 006: Add Output Quality Rubric Scorer

## What To Build

Add a separate quality scoring layer for output completeness, maintainability,
relevance, proof quality, and unnecessary ceremony. It must not replace route,
proof, trace, or claim pass/fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Quality scorer can flag incomplete proof, irrelevant output, unmaintainable
  output, and over-ceremonial tiny-task handling.
- Rubric output labels each dimension as deterministic, LLM-judged, or
  human-only.
- Default deterministic `skill-eval.ps1` behavior remains stable unless quality
  scoring is explicitly requested or documented as part of a later gate.

## Verification

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval-quality.ps1`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval.ps1`
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. Output quality scoring now covers completeness, maintainability,
relevance, proof quality, and right-sized ceremony with explicit judge labels.
The self-test suite includes one pass and four intentional failures.
