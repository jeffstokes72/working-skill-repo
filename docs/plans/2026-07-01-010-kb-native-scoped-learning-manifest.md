# KB: kb-native, component-scoped learning (de-atv)

## Origin

Goal: `docs/context/goals/kb-native-scoped-learning.md`

Two coupled changes surfaced from live use (the fleet-eval face-ID wrong-reference
incident showed learning was too generic to attach to the failing component):

1. **De-atv / kb-native**: the skill bundle stores learning + run state under an
   `.atv/` root and reads an optional atv hook feed. Make the bundle self-contained
   under kb-owned roots so it does not depend on the ATV install. Keep the mechanics
   adopted from ATV (learn/evolve/compound), but under KB ownership.
2. **Component-scoped learning**: the instinct schema has only a coarse `domain`
   enum and one global `project.yaml`. There is no way to attach a lesson to the
   exact component that needs it. Add a `scope` field + a component-local tier so
   `/learn` can hit the specific part (e.g. an image-comparer's calibration) and
   `/evolve` can promote scoped instincts into component-owned skills/docs.
   **Scoped-by-default** (Mark, 2026-07-01): "x pipeline doesn't need to know about
   learning from y pipeline unless there are pattern similarities." Ordinary lessons
   default to their component scope; they reach global ONLY via cross-scope
   recurrence (same pattern in >= 2 scopes). Verified high-severity landmines are an
   instant one-shot learn at their owning scope; small lessons never default global.

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change` — edits several portable KB skills + the Go verification
harness + installer + visible docs. No new app runtime.

## Canonical roots (decided; recorded as safe assumption)

- Durable, git-tracked knowledge -> `docs/context/kb/` (instincts, kb-completions,
  scoped instincts). Matches the direction the installed evolve already drifted to.
- Ephemeral, gitignored run artifacts -> `.kb/` (snapshots, qa-screenshots,
  observations.jsonl), replacing `.atv/`.
- Component-scoped instincts -> `docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope>.yaml`,
  plus an optional `scope:` field on any instinct. **Default scope is the active
  component, not `project`.** Pull rule: when working a component, load that
  component's scoped instincts + global; never other components' scopes. A lesson
  reaches global (`scope: project`) only via promotion-on-recurrence (same pattern
  in >= 2 scopes). Verified high-severity landmines are instant one-shot, scoped.

## Scope boundary

- This plan changes the skill bundle only. Applying component-scoped learning to a
  specific downstream component (e.g. the llmcommune fleet-eval image comparer's
  `calibration.yaml` + fixtures) is a separate, downstream consumer task in that
  repo — named here, not executed here.
- The optional ATV observer hook (`.github/hooks/copilot-hooks.json`) is not
  reintroduced. Passive tool-use capture becomes optional, not required.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|-------|------------|--------------|------|--------|
| 011 | kb-native learning contract (roots + scope schema) | - | verification-only | no | done |
| 012 | learn: kb-native store + scoped write | 011 | verification-only | no | done |
| 013 | evolve: kb-native path + scoped promotion (fix drift) | 011 | verification-only | no | done |
| 014 | de-atv kb-* + klfg (snapshots/qa/observations/completions) | 011 | verification-only | no | done |
| 015 | kbcheck Go harness + gitignore + installer | 012,013,014 | tdd (unit) | no | done |
| 016 | migrate state + docs/proof surface | 015 | verification-only | no | done |

## Goal Link

Update `docs/context/goals/kb-native-scoped-learning.md` as each slice finishes.
Goal stays active until kbcheck core + go test pass and the docs proof is recorded.
