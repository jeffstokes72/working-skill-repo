## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add workflow-shape route fixtures | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Add compact shape classifier to kb-start and manifests | slice-001 | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Implement loaded-surface reporting | - | integration | no | done |
| 4 | Trim base and core workflow skills behind measurements | slice-001, slice-003 | integration | no | done |
| 5 | Clean reference graph and deletion blockers | - | integration | no | done |

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change`: changes routing, lint/eval proof, and loaded skill
surface. It is not a coded pipeline framework slice.

## Done Criteria

- Route fixtures distinguish direct edit, normal plan, pipeline, and epic work.
- `kb-start` classifies shape cheaply without escalating every request.
- Loaded-surface reductions are measured before and after trims.
- Known stale skill references are fixed or explicitly parked.
