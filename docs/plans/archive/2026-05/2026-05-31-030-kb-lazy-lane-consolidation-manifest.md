# KB: Lazy Lane Consolidation

## Origin

Brainstorms:

- `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-31-architecture-deepening-lane-requirements.md`
- `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-31-narrow-lane-trim-requirements.md`
- `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-31-questionable-global-skill-trim-requirements.md`

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create architecture deepening lazy lane | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Absorb TDD anti-cheat behavior into pipeline | - | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Merge todo skills around root todo.md | - | integration | no | done |
| 4 | Audit narrow lanes for deletion safety | slice-003 | integration | no | done |
| 5 | Codify propagation policy | - | docs-check | yes | done |

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change`: consolidates lazy lanes and deletion candidates behind
route/reference proof.

## Done Criteria

- Architecture deepening is lazy and route-distinct.
- TDD anti-cheat behavior survives in pipeline artifacts.
- Todo skills align with root `todo.md`; no `backlog.md` added.
- Narrow lanes are kept, merged, or parked only with deletion proof.
- Propagation policy is explicit.
