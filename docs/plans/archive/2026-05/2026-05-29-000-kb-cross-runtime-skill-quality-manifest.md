# KB: Cross-Runtime Skill Quality

## Origin

Brainstorm: `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-29-cross-runtime-skill-quality-requirements.md`

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | Test Level | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define cross-runtime quality contract | - | verification-only | none | no | done |
| 2 | Add deterministic skill lint | slice-001 | functional-cli | functional-cli | no | done |
| 3 | Add route and complexity eval fixtures | slice-001 | functional-cli | functional-cli | no | done |
| 4 | Wire skill quality into kb-check | slice-002, slice-003 | functional-cli | functional-cli | no | done |
| 5 | Add read-only sync drift report | slice-001 | functional-cli | functional-cli | no | done |
| 6 | Document canonical quality workflow | slice-004, slice-005 | verification-only | none | no | done |

## Assumptions

- PowerShell is the first implementation target because the existing `kb-check` helper is PowerShell and the repo is currently Windows-oriented.
- Route eval fixtures can be deterministic metadata checks first; model-scored cross-model evals are out of scope for this manifest.
- GHCP compatibility means the artifacts must be readable and useful from GitHub Copilot/Copilot Chat contexts even when Codex-only tool APIs are unavailable.

## Completion Criteria

- All slices are done or intentionally skipped.
- `kb-check` discovers and can run skill-quality checks in this repo.
- The route-complexity fixture suite includes Codex/GHCP applicability metadata.
- The sync report is read-only and clearly separates required targets from optional omissions.

## Completion Review

- Review: P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0 from local completion review. Subagent review was not run because this session does not have explicit user authorization for parallel agents.
- Follow-up resolution: resolved 1 runner resilience issue in `scripts/route-complexity-eval.ps1`.
- Proof: `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`, PowerShell parser check for all scripts, JSON summary checks for all three new runners, and `git diff --check`.
- Compound: skipped - the durable workflow is already captured in `README.md`, `docs/context/operations/testing.md`, and this manifest.
- Learn: no new project instinct written; existing cross-project instinct still applies.
- Evolve: skipped; completion count is 1, not divisible by 5.
- Project memory: refreshed in `docs/context/PROJECT.md`, `docs/context/operations/testing.md`, `docs/context/memory-maintenance.md`, and `todo.md`.
- Memory maintenance: closed repeated-rediscovery and stale-doc signals; ATV optional target decision remains open.
- Cleanup: active handoff moved to `docs/handoffs/done/`.
