# KB: Proof Pipeline Spike

## Origin

Epic: `docs/context/epics/skill-minimalism-and-proof-harness.md`

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Persist skill-eval regression baselines | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Build tiny coded pipeline spike | - | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Add protected oracle pipeline contract | slice-002 | integration | no | done |

## Workflow Shape

`pipeline-change`: touches scripts, config, eval proof behavior, docs, and KB
workflow contracts.

## Done Criteria

- Skill eval baselines persist and can fail on regression.
- Pipeline spike creates a run directory, selected pipeline record, phase
  context packet, protected-file manifest, and proof summary.
- Protected oracle behavior is represented in plan/work/check artifacts without
  keeping standalone TDD globally loaded.
