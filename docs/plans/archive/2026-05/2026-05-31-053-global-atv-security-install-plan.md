# Slice 053: Global ATV Security Install

## What To Build

Install only the approved `atv-security` skill into global skill targets and marketplace approved skill storage, then pin the final hash in the marketplace catalog.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Marketplace, Codex, Copilot, and shared agents `atv-security/SKILL.md` files match the trusted ATV source hash.
- `approved-skills.json` pins the same final hash.
- No quarantine file is linked, approved, or copied into global targets.
- No unrelated marketplace or global skill is changed.

## Test Scenarios

- `Get-FileHash` over source, marketplace, and global targets returns one unique SHA256.
- `scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak.ps1` passes.
- `scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak-selftest.ps1` proves the negative case still fails.

## Scope Boundary

Do not bulk-install all ATV skills. Do not make the marketplace folder a global load root. Do not overwrite unrelated global skill drift.
