# KB: Warning Quality Cleanup

## Origin

User requested a surgical `kb-plan -> kb-work -> kb-complete` pass for the
remaining accepted warnings.

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change` - edits skill contracts, lint output, sync reporting, and
docs; no new harness architecture.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add missing argument hints | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Codify local review fallback | - | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Compact optional sync warnings | - | integration | no | done |

## Done Criteria

- Missing `argument-hint` warnings are removed without changing workflow behavior.
- `kb-review` and `kb-complete` no longer imply multi-agent review when the
  runtime cannot spawn reviewers.
- `skill-sync-report` reports optional ATV scaffold/plugin differences compactly
  by default while preserving detailed output behind an explicit switch.
- Canonical gate, diff check, and required sync report pass.

## Completion Review

- Review: P0=0 P1=0 P2=0 P3=0.
- Review mode: local-fallback. No subagent reviewers were spawned.
- Follow-up resolution: resolved 0, logged 0, blocked 0.
- Proof: `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`,
  `git diff --check`, and `scripts\skill-sync-report.ps1` passed.
- Learn: skipped - warning cleanup only; no repo-specific landmine or reusable
  implementation pattern.
- Evolve: skipped - completion count not divisible by 5.
- Project memory: refreshed operational testing note.
- Memory maintenance: no new signals.
- Compact: skipped - long-skill warnings are a separate measured trim pass.
