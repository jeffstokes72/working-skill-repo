# KB: Learning Landmines

## Origin

Brainstorm: `docs/brainstorms/2026-05-31-repo-local-learning-landmines-requirements.md`

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define local landmine schema and lifecycle | - | docs-check | no | done |
| 2 | Add landmine evidence fields to learn flow | slice-001 | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Gate evolve promotion and sync | slice-001 | integration | yes | done |
| 4 | Load and resolve active landmines through KB workflows | slice-001 | integration | no | done |

## Workflow Shape

`skill-bundle-change`: touches workflow skills and repo-local memory contracts.

## Done Criteria

- Landmines have owner, evidence, severity, fix condition, and verification.
- Fixed landmines archive immediately after proof.
- `evolve` keeps numeric maturity gates and adds explicit human approval before
  portable-bundle promotion or sync.
