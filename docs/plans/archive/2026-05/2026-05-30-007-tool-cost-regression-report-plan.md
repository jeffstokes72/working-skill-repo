# Slice 007: Add Cost And Regression Reporting

## What To Build

Add a local report that answers whether live eval quality improved, regressed, or
shifted spend. It should use available cost proxies: wall-clock time, model,
tool count when parseable, retries, prompt/result sizes, and transcript/log
sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Report can summarize a current run directory.
- Report can compare current results to a selected baseline.
- Missing token/cost data is represented as unavailable, not zero.
- Output is local JSON and Markdown; external dashboards remain exporter-only.

## Verification

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval-regression-report.ps1 -RunRoot .atv/eval-runs`
- Synthetic baseline comparison with a small checked-in fixture or generated temp fixture.
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. The report summarizes local `.atv/eval-runs` artifacts and supports
baseline comparison. Verification used the current ignored eval-run artifacts
and a self-comparison baseline check.
