# Slice 052: ATV Security OSV Propagation

## What To Build

Update the trusted ATV `atv-security` skill so A06 dependency checks prefer OSV Scanner machine evidence when available, then propagate the same skill body to ATV shipped copies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The A06 section requires `osv-scanner scan source -r <repo-or-scope-path> --format json --output-file docs/security/osv-YYYY-MM-DD.json` when manifests or lockfiles exist and `osv-scanner` is available.
- The skill records command, exit code, JSON report path, and severity counts.
- Critical/high known vulnerabilities become findings; version-age-only claims do not become vulnerability findings.
- Absence of `osv-scanner` is recorded as `skipped-unavailable` with the install command.
- All targeted ATV copies have identical `SKILL.md` hashes.

## Test Scenarios

- `Select-String` confirms the final skill names OSV, skip behavior, and no-fix behavior.
- `Get-FileHash` confirms all targeted ATV `SKILL.md` copies match the trusted source.
- `git -C <atv-repo> diff --check` passes for touched files.

## Scope Boundary

Do not run `osv-scanner fix`. Do not rewrite the broader ATV security taxonomy. Do not touch unrelated dirty ATV KB skill sync changes.
