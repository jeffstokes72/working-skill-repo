# Slice 054: Completion Proof

## What To Build

Finish the promotion with machine-verifiable proof, status updates, and targeted project memory refresh so a fresh session knows the marketplace/global security state.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Marketplace JSON parses.
- Hash equality is proven across trusted ATV source, ATV shipped copies, marketplace approved copy, and global targets.
- Firebreak and firebreak negative selftest pass.
- Canonical `kb-check -All` passes with only known/accepted warnings.
- `git diff --check` passes in every touched repo.
- The manifest records scope-check, proof, review mode, and completion status.

## Test Scenarios

- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak.ps1`.
- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/skill-marketplace-firebreak-selftest.ps1`.
- Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./.github/skills/kb-check/scripts/kb-check.ps1 -All`.
- Run `git diff --check` in `<working-skill-repo>`, `<agent-marketplace>`, and `<atv-repo>`.

## Scope Boundary

Do not run unrelated app tests. Do not require live OSV execution when the scanner binary is unavailable. Do not stage or commit unrelated dirty ATV work.
