# Slice 051: Promote ATV Security Into Marketplace

## What To Build

Promote `atv-security` as a trusted, explicitly approved security skill in `<agent-marketplace>`, with a matching OSV harness entry and clear docs that this is approved catalog content, not quarantine.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `catalog/approved-skills.json` contains exactly one approved `atv-security` entry with source path, approval reason, final SHA256, and proof commands.
- `catalog/harness-index.json` lists `dependency-vulnerability-osv`.
- `harnesses/dependency-vulnerability-osv.json` is valid JSON and describes command, inputs, pass criteria, and skip behavior.
- Marketplace docs make clear that quarantine is not loadable and `atv-security` is approved by exception as trusted ATV security tooling.

## Test Scenarios

- Parse all edited/new JSON files with PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json`.
- Compare catalog SHA256 to the final marketplace `skills/atv-security/SKILL.md` SHA256.
- Run the skill-repo firebreak check to prove no approved catalog entry resolves into quarantine.

## Scope Boundary

Do not promote unrelated ATV skills. Do not convert marketplace into a global runtime root. Do not install public or quarantined skills.
