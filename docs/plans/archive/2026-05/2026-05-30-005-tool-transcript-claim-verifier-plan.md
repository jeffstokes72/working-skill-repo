# Slice 005: Add Transcript-Derived Claim Verifier

## What To Build

Add a verifier that checks final-answer or transcript-derived claims against
actual files, git state, commands, logs, and artifacts. Candidate extraction may
start simple, but pass/fail must come from deterministic checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Self-tests include one true claim, one false claim, and one ambiguous claim.
- False claims fail deterministically.
- Ambiguous claims are reported without becoming proof.
- Structured `claim_checks` remain supported and stable.

## Verification

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval-claims.ps1`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval.ps1`
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. Claim artifact verification now has true, false, and ambiguous self-tests.
`skill-eval` checks result-level `claim_artifacts` and the self-test suite now
proves both pass and fail integration paths.
