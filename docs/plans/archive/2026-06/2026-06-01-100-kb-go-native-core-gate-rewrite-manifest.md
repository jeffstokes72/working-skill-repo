# KB: Go Native Core Gate Rewrite

## Origin

Epic: `docs/context/epics/cold-storage-follow-through.md`

Human decision: full non-PowerShell rewrite if it works for Windows+; remove
PS1 after proof.

## Workflow Shape

`pipeline-change` - this changes the core proof gate, release gate, docs, skill
sync behavior, and cross-runtime portability claims.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Define native Go gate parity contract | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Implement native Go kb-check core runner | slice-101 | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Implement native Go release gate | slice-102 | integration | no | done |
| 4 | Prove PS1 and Go parity on Windows | slice-103 | integration | no | done |
| 5 | Remove PS1 gate dependency after proof | slice-104 | integration | no | done |

## Non-Negotiables

- The old top-level PS1 wrappers remain until Go parity proof passes on Windows.
- Go owns top-level `core` and `local-release` orchestration. Individual
  PowerShell validator scripts may remain until each validator is separately
  ported.
- `live-release` keeps live model calls explicit.
- If Go parity fails, stop before PS1 removal and keep the existing PS1 gate.

## Final Verification Target

- `go test ./...`
- Go native `core`
- Go native `local-release`
- Old PS1 `kb-check -All` and `kb-release-gate.ps1 -Profile local-release`
  in the parity report before removal
- Parity report showing matched pass/fail/check lists
- `scripts\skill-sync-report.ps1`
- `git diff --check`
