# KB: Cold Storage Follow Through

## Origin

Epic: `docs/context/epics/cold-storage-follow-through.md`

## Workflow Shape

`multi-stream-epic` - remaining work spans deletion proof, benchmark assets,
Copilot instruction routing, and a separate cross-platform rewrite decision.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prove minimality candidates before deletion | - | integration | no | done |
| 2 | Add cross-model benchmark prompt pack | - | integration | no | done |
| 3 | Add high-value Copilot path instructions | - | integration | no | done |
| 4 | Decide Go harness rewrite scope | - | hitl | yes | completed |

## Assumptions

- No deletion is approved by this manifest.
- Live model benchmark execution remains explicit and outside the local Go gate.
- Go-native gate parity passed on Windows; old top-level PS wrappers were
  removed after proof.

## Final Verification Target

- `go test ./...`
- `go run .\cmd\kbcheck core`
- `go run .\cmd\kbcheck local-release`
- `scripts\skill-sync-report.ps1`
- `git diff --check`
