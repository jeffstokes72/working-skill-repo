# KB: Phoenix Proof Spine Merge

## Origin

Research: `docs/context/research/2026-07-05-atv-phoenix-self-heal-comparison.md`

The latest Phoenix repo was useful, but not as a replacement. The plan keeps KB's
workflow and learning model, then ports the Phoenix-style executable proof spine
into `cmd/kbcheck`.

## What Mine Is Better At Overall

KB is better as the project operating system:

- app-local scoped learning with ancestor-only pull and recurrence-based promotion;
- richer route selection across fix, troubleshoot, brainstorm, plan, work,
  complete, ship, epic, and durable goals;
- repo-local memory: project maps, handoffs, eval maps, todo ledgers, solutions,
  and scoped instincts;
- completion discipline: review, QA, proof/demo evidence, compound, learn,
  evolve, memory refresh, and sync gates.

Phoenix is better at one proof primitive: computed failure-first acceptance from
trace state. That is what this plan adopts.

## Decomposition Answer

KB decomposition already looks at slices "to the letter" for verticality,
dependencies, verification mode, `test_level`, `functional_risk`, HITL, and
expected files. It does not yet encode which model tier can safely run each
slice. Slice 005 adds that.

Model tiers are capability tiers, not permanent provider names:

| Tier | Use For | Current Examples Checked 2026-07-05 |
|---|---|---|
| `large` | unclear decomposition, architecture, security/destructive risk, long-context conflict resolution, final P0/P1 judgment | `gpt-5.5`, Claude Fable/Opus-class |
| `medium` | ordinary implementation with clear acceptance criteria and runnable proof | Claude Sonnet-class, strong coding model equivalents |
| `small` | bounded classification, fixtures, boilerplate, docs, log summaries, narrow patches with fixed oracle | `gpt-5.4-mini`, Claude Haiku-class |
| `tiny` | deterministic transforms, grep inventories, table updates, hash/status summaries | fastest local/tiny model or no LLM |

If a provider calls a model `ds4` or similar, the contract should classify it by
measured capability in this repo, not by marketing name.

## Slice Overview

| # | Slice | Blocked By | Verification | Model | HITL | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | kbcheck sense/trace/accept proof spine | - | tdd/integration | medium | no | done |
| 002 | repair/troubleshoot failure-first acceptance | 001 | integration | medium | no | done |
| 003 | goal/work/complete proof ledger | 001 | integration | large | no | done |
| 004 | measured adoption gate for learn/evolve | 001 | tdd/integration | large | no | done |
| 005 | model-tier decomposition contract | - | integration | large | no | done |
| 006 | docs/eval/sync cleanup | 002,003,004,005 | verification-only | small | no | done |

## Work Boundary

Do not import Phoenix's full skill pack. Do not replace KB's scoped learning
store. Do not add an automatic global-learning path. Shared/global promotion must
earn it through recurrence or measured adoption proof.

## Completion Evidence

- Review: `review-mode: local-fallback`; P0=0, P1=1 resolved, P2=0, P3=0.
- Follow-up resolution: resolved 1, logged 0, blocked 0.
- Proof/demo evidence: `go test ./cmd/kbcheck`, proof-spine RED->GREEN smoke,
  learning-adoption ADOPT_ELIGIBLE smoke, `go run ./cmd/kbcheck
  manifest-contract`, `go run ./cmd/kbcheck local-release`, working
  `git diff --check`, and ATV `git diff --check` passed.
- Compound: wrote
  `docs/solutions/logic-errors/proof-spine-digest-check-semantics-2026-07-05.md`.
- Learn: added scoped instinct
  `docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/kbcheck-proof-spine.yaml`.
- Evolve: skipped; completion counter moved from 11 to 12.
- Project memory: refreshed `docs/context/operations/testing.md`,
  `docs/context/eval-map.md`, `docs/context/architecture/kb-workflow.md`,
  `docs/context/architecture/kb-learning-model.md`, and
  `docs/context/memory-maintenance.md`.
- Cleanup: no QA screenshots; `.kb/observations.jsonl` appended with the
  resolved P1 review finding.
- Alerts: none.
