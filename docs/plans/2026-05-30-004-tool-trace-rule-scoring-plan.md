# Slice 004: Expand Deterministic Trace Rule Scoring

## What To Build

Teach the scorer to verify required workflow reads/tools/commands and forbidden
shortcuts where fixtures or result metadata define them. This should catch cases
where an agent routes correctly but skips the evidence-gathering discipline the
skill requires.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Self-tests include at least one pass and one intentional fail for required
  file reads or commands.
- Self-tests include at least one intentional fail for a forbidden shortcut.
- Existing self-tests continue to pass.
- The new rule format is documented and deterministic.

## Verification

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval.ps1`
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. `skill-eval` now supports optional `trace_rules` for required and
forbidden files, commands, and tools. The self-test suite now has 7 files,
including passing trace-rule coverage and intentional required/forbidden trace
failures.
