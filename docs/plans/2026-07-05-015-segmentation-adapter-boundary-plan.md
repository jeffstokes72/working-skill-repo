# Slice 005 - Custom Instructions, Segmentation, and Adapter Boundary

## What To Build

Make ownership crisp enough that cheap workers get packets, not broad planning
authority.

Use this split:

| Surface | Owns |
|---|---|
| Custom instruction | ambient host/project policy, invariants, and always-loaded constraints |
| Command | host/user entrypoint and arguments |
| Skill | workflow policy, gates, artifacts, escalation, proof |
| Agent | narrow capability/persona and evidence rules |
| Subagent | one runtime invocation with one packet and one result |
| Tool | deterministic side effect or query with compact output |
| Adapter | host/runtime mechanics outside the core planning contract |

## Acceptance Criteria

- A decision note states the ownership contract.
- `kb-start` and `kb-work` point to the same segmentation model.
- Custom instructions such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or Copilot instructions
  carry stable repo/runtime invariants, not live task state or full workflow
  bodies.
- The first adapter boundary is for the runtime the user actually runs daily.
- The core packet schema does not require a Claude-, Codex-, or HumanLayer-only
  field.
- `kbcheck` can at least report obvious surface inventory risks, even if full
  enforcement stays future work.

## Scope Boundary

Do not build every adapter now. Build the boundary for one daily runtime and
make the second adapter a later proof of generality.

## Verification

Run:

```shell
go test ./cmd/kbcheck/...
go run ./cmd/kbcheck core
```
