# Model Routing Distribution

## What To Build

Make the advisory pilot easy to copy/install: platform binaries are optional enhancements, the installer verifies them, and the file-copy skill path remains fully functional with `router-unavailable` fallback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- One installer command installs skills and the matching prebuilt router when available without requiring Go.
- Upgrade/uninstall are deterministic, checksummed, backup-safe, and cross-platform.
- Missing/incompatible binary leaves ordinary KB work usable on the current model.
- Tagged artifacts have checksums and GitHub build provenance; docs do not claim code signing that was not performed.
- Working, global Codex/Copilot/agents, and ATV copies are diff-reviewed then hash-synced; release gates pass.

## Test Scenarios

- Windows/macOS/Linux install, same-version skip, upgrade, uninstall, offline/missing release, checksum mismatch, and skill-only use.
- Global/ATV drift before sync and hash equality after sync.
- README support matrix distinguishes Codex pilot, later cohorts, and router-unavailable fallback.

## Tier Rationale

Large: release automation, supply-chain integrity, cross-platform install, and multi-repo sync are broad/high-risk.

## Scope Boundary

No tag publication, merge, default-branch push, forced sync overwrite, or claim of unavailable signing/provider support.

## Current Proof Status

Installer 19/19, release-tag contract 3/3, broad Go proof, manifest contract,
diff integrity, canonical no-paid evidence, and required skill sync are green.
The proof runner now bounds time/output, contains whole process trees, and
reports active release checks. `.gitattributes` keeps hash-bound fixtures and
skills byte-stable across Windows checkouts; runtime bytecode caches do not
change skill identity. Exact `go run ./cmd/kbcheck local-release` passes on the
final staged delivery candidate; its proven tree is recorded in delivery
metadata.
