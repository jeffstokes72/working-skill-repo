# Slice 003 - Planner/Worker Packet Integration

## What To Build

Make KB's expensive planner produce enough structured packet data that a cheaper
worker can execute a bounded slice without rediscovering the repo.

The planning ladder is:

1. questions;
2. objective research;
3. design concept;
4. structure outline;
5. tactical vertical slices;
6. per-slice context packet;
7. work execution and proof update.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `kb-plan` explains when split artifacts and packets are required.
- `kb-work` reads the packet first and escalates if the packet is insufficient.
- `kbcheck` catches at least one missing-packet or malformed-packet case.
- Low-risk doc-only tasks can stay compact; the spike must not add ceremony to
  every tiny edit.
- Existing gate-ledger behavior remains intact.

## Scope Boundary

Do not add multiple runtime adapters in this slice. Use the packet contract as
the shared boundary.

## Verification

Run:

```shell
go test ./cmd/kbcheck/...
go run ./cmd/kbcheck core
```
