# Slice 002: Wire Adapter Dry-Runs Into Canonical Checks

## What To Build

Extend the default quality gate so adapter plumbing is checked without model
calls. Codex and GHCP dry-runs should both run under `kb-check -All`; live model
runs remain explicit commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `kb-check -List` shows Codex and GHCP adapter dry-run checks when scripts
  exist.
- `kb-check -All` runs both dry-runs and exits nonzero if either adapter plumbing
  breaks.
- Docs clearly separate deterministic dry-run coverage from explicit live evals.
- Required skill copies are synced after changing `kb-check`.

## Verification

- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -List`
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-sync-report.ps1`
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. `kb-check -All` now runs both Codex and GHCP adapter dry-runs, and required
global/ATV skill copies were synced.
