# Slice 003: Add Live Cross-Runtime Corpus Runner

## What To Build

Create an explicit runner that can execute all route fixtures across Codex and
GHCP adapters and emit a machine-readable summary. It must distinguish pass,
adapter failure, invalid JSON, deterministic score failure, runtime unavailable,
and skipped-by-platform states.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The runner supports all current route fixtures and both runtimes.
- The summary includes runtime, fixture id, expected route, actual route,
  pass/fail/skip category, duration, exit code, and artifact paths.
- Live calls are never run by default `kb-check -All`.
- Failed runs leave enough logs to debug without re-running.

## Verification

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval-run-live-corpus.ps1 -FixtureId tiny-typo-fix -Runtime codex -DryRun`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\skill-eval-run-live-corpus.ps1 -All -Runtime codex,ghcp -DryRun`
- One explicit live Codex smoke run if auth is available.
- `git diff --check`

## Result

Done. Dry-run corpus orchestration passed for all 8 current fixtures across both
Codex and GHCP adapters: 16 pass results.
