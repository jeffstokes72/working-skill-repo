# Slice 003: Propagate And Verify Eval-Map Skill Bundle

## What To Build

Propagate the approved `kb-eval-map` skill to required runtime targets and verify
the skill repo remains clean.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Required Codex, Copilot, agents, and ATV `.github` skill targets contain the
  same `kb-eval-map/SKILL.md` hash as the working repo.
- `scripts/skill-sync-report.ps1` reports zero required issues.
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All` exits 0.
- `git diff --check` exits 0 in touched repos.

## Verification

- Run `scripts/skill-sync-report.ps1`.
- Run `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All`.
- Run `git diff --check` in `<working-skill-repo>` and `<atv-repo>`.

Result:

- Required target hashes match for `kb-eval-map` and `kb-map-bootstrap`.
- `scripts/skill-sync-report.ps1` reported 0 required issues.
- `.\.github\skills\kb-check\scripts\kb-check.ps1 -All` exited 0.
- `git diff --check` exited 0 in `<working-skill-repo>` and
  `<atv-repo>`.
