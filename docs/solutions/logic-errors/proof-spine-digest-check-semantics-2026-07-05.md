# Proof spine digests must include all check semantics

## Problem

`kbcheck accept` relies on a check digest to decide whether prior RED/GREEN trace
events apply to the current check. If the digest omits a field that changes the
check's behavior, an agent can accidentally reuse proof from a different check.

## Symptoms

- A trace history looks intact, but it was produced under different check
  semantics.
- A repair can appear to satisfy RED-before-GREEN even though the current sensor
  is easier, looser, or otherwise different from the sensor that recorded RED.

## What Didn't Work

- Hashing only `kind`, `target`, `expect`, and the target file content was not
  enough. `timeout_ms` changes command behavior too.
- Relying on the current GREEN run alone would reintroduce the latest-green proof
  gap the proof spine is meant to close.

## Solution

Include every behavior-changing field in the canonical check digest. For the
current proof spine that means positive `timeout_ms` values are part of the
digest, and tests prove the digest changes when the timeout changes.

Also reject fractional expected exit codes instead of silently truncating JSON
numbers such as `1.5` to `1`.

## Why This Works

The trace is only useful when each event is bound to the exact same sensor. By
including timeout semantics in the digest, the RED event and the final
acceptance check must agree on the command, expected result, target file content
when applicable, and timeout behavior.

## Prevention

- When adding a new `ProofCheck` field, decide whether it changes sensing
  semantics. If yes, add it to `proofCheckDigest`.
- Add a digest-change regression test for each new semantic field.
- Keep `accept` strict: RED-before-GREEN proof should fail closed when the check
  definition changes.
