# Todo

## Rules

**This file is the single source of truth for active skill-bundle work.** Keep it small; move finished summaries to `todo-done.md`.

Status markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⬜ pending | Ready when blockers clear |
| 🔧 in_progress | Agent claimed and actively working |
| ✅ done | Complete and verified |
| 🔒 blocked | Cannot proceed; explain under Blocked |
| ⊘ skipped | Intentionally skipped with reason |
| 🛑 human-required | Needs human input or approval |

Promotion rules:

- Newly discovered work goes to Parked / Cold Storage unless explicitly in scope.
- Refresh parked work older than 72 hours before execution.
- Use `docs/context/PROJECT.md` as the fresh-session map.
- Use `docs/context/memory-maintenance.md` for map/doc quality issues.

## Objective

Make this the highest-reliability portable skill bundle for the user's workflow: low ceremony, complexity-aware routing, autonomous verification, fresh-session recovery, and drift-safe propagation.

## Current Focus

No active work claimed. Claude remaining hardening is complete. The Go wrapper
exists as a thin PowerShell-delegating entrypoint. Trim/deletion is constrained:
protected CE/document-review dependencies are excluded from deletion candidates,
and remaining cold-storage candidates require runtime usage proof or focused
trimming before any cut.

## Current Truth

- This repo is the working source for portable skills under `.github/skills/`.
- Personal/global installs and tracked ATV skill roots are expected to match this repo for KB skills.
- ATV scaffold/plugin copies are no longer intentionally thin for tracked skills.
- Deterministic skill lint, route-complexity fixtures, captured-result scoring, observed trace scoring, claim verification, computed output-quality checks, regression reporting, sync drift checks, and Codex/GHCP live adapters exist. Live model calls remain explicit and outside `kb-check -All`.
- `cmd/kbcheck` provides a Go CLI wrapper for `core`, `local-release`, and
  `live-release`; it still requires PowerShell and is not a full harness port.
- `skill-surface-minimality.ps1` has a protected classification so repo-policy
  dependencies such as `ce-review`, `ce-compound`, `ce-compound-refresh`, and
  `document-review` do not become deletion candidates from static analysis
  alone.
- ATV upstream resync must be category-merged from original `All-The-Vibes/ATV-StarterKit` `upstream/main`, not the fork. KB is preserved as this repo's overlay; original ATV is a source to mine, not a mirror target. Superseded workflow skills (`lfg`, `slfg`, `workflows-*`, CE workflow aliases replaced by KB lanes) stay out unless the app uses them or a focused porting plan proves value. The useful upstream `ce-review` mechanics are already present in local references.

## Queued Improvements

## Handoff Queue

| Handoff | Status | Route | Created | Stale Check | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Human Required

- None.

## Parked / Cold Storage

- Runtime-usage proof for remaining cold-storage candidates from
  `scripts/skill-surface-minimality.ps1`: 10 unproven agents, one trim-candidate
  agent (`cli-agent-readiness-reviewer`), and one trim-candidate skill
  (`kb-map-bootstrap`). Do not delete without usage proof or a focused trim
  plan.
- Full Go harness rewrite. The current `cmd/kbcheck` wrapper intentionally
  delegates to PowerShell; promote a rewrite only when non-PowerShell support is
  worth the cost.
- Build cross-model benchmark prompts for route selection, complexity, and proof discipline.
- Add path-specific `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for Copilot if the workflow starts editing multiple file classes with different rules.

## Blocked

None.

## Work Log

- 2026-05-31: Hardened future-work gaps: computed output-quality scoring from raw result JSON, collapsed `kb-start` to one ranked routing list, and made harness subprocesses prefer PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) with Windows PowerShell fallback. Proof: `kb-check -All`, `skill-sync-report`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-05-31: Planned ATV upstream resync as a six-slice epic. Original ATV `upstream/main` is authoritative for inspecting ATV-native changes; KB-owned skills are preserved as this repo's overlay, shared overlap skills get three-way review, and superseded workflow skills stay out unless currently used.
- 2026-05-31: Completed ATV upstream resync correction. Backed out transient `lfg`, `slfg`, and `workflows-*` imports, rejected upstream KB deletions and the `atv-security` OSV regression, kept globals clean, and confirmed useful upstream `ce-review` mechanics are already present locally. Proof: `kb-check -All`, `skill-sync-report`, working/ATV/marketplace `git diff --check`, focused review-skill diff, and direct `Test-Path` checks for removed workflow dirs.
- 2026-05-29: Completed cross-runtime skill quality manifest. `kb-check -All` now runs skill lint, route-complexity evals, and read-only sync drift report for Codex and GHCP.
- 2026-05-30: Completed `kb-eval-map` manifest. Bootstrap now invokes repo-native eval mapping; required Codex/Copilot/agents/ATV skill copies are synced; proof: `kb-check -All` and `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-05-30: Added deterministic `skill-eval` scorer for captured skill result JSON. `kb-check -All` now self-tests route/proof/claim failures before sync drift.
- 2026-05-30: Added Codex live skill eval adapter. `scripts/skill-eval-run-codex.ps1` runs route fixtures through `codex exec`, captures schema JSON, and scores it with `skill-eval`; dry-run is included in `kb-check -All`.
- 2026-05-30: Planned the remaining live cross-runtime eval harness: GHCP adapter, live corpus runner, trace/claim scoring, output quality, cost regression, and eval-map negative validation.
- 2026-05-30: Completed the live cross-runtime eval harness. GHCP adapter, corpus runner, trace/claim scoring, output-quality selftests, regression reports, and eval-map scaffold negative-validation are implemented and documented.
- 2026-05-31: Planned the skill minimalism/proof harness epic into four manifests: proof pipeline spike, learning landmines, routing trim, and lazy lane consolidation.
- 2026-05-31: Completed and reviewed the skill minimalism/proof harness epic. Proof: `kb-check -All`, `git diff --check`, and required sync report passed; one baseline-regression review finding was fixed.
- 2026-05-31: Completed warning-quality cleanup. Missing `argument-hint` warnings were removed, review local fallback was codified, and optional sync drift output was compacted by default.
- 2026-06-01: Planned Claude remaining hardening into release confidence, skill-surface minimality classification, read-only upstream delta report, and parked Go wrapper plus trim/deletion queues. Manifest: `docs/plans/2026-06-01-080-kb-claude-remaining-hardening-manifest.md`.
- 2026-06-01: Completed Claude remaining hardening. Added release confidence gate profiles, skill/agent minimality classification, read-only ATV upstream delta reporting, and fixed a concurrent baseline-selftest temp-directory collision found during completion. Proof: `kb-check -All`, `kb-release-gate.ps1 -Profile local-release`, `skill-sync-report`, protected selftests, and `git diff --check` passed.
